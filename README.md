# Cipher Terminal v1.0

An interactive, terminal-based cryptography suite built in Python. This was a hobby project by myself to learn Python and practice cryptography. While I did write my own code, I impletmented code from various open-source resources as well.

* **Personal Use:** Free to use and modify.
* **Distribution:** If you share or change this code, you must keep it under the same license and keep the source code public.
* **Commercial:** You cannot incorporate this into paid/closed-source software.

## Features
* **Practice Mode:** Encode or decode messages and quotes. 
* **Hints:** There is a hint aviable to help in the practice mode but it is in early developments and needs future work/
* **Input Mode:** Encrypt or decrypt your own messages.
* **Stats Tracking:** Tracking statistics like speed, ciphers completed, hints, etc.

## Supported Ciphers
* Caesar, ROT13, Atbash, Vigenere, Affine, Rail Fence, Hill (2x2), and Base64. There are plans for more to be added in the near future.

## Future Implementations / TODO
* **Ciphers:** Add more ciphers, like 3x3 Hill Cipher or Nihilist. 
* **UI:** Improving the UI, with possible GUI wrapper.

* **Hint System:** Improving the hint system.
