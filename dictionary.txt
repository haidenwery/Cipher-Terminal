I AM GOING TO MAKE HIM AN OFFER HE CANNOT REFUSE
MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU ALWAYS AND IN ALL WAYS
FRANKLY MY DEAR I DO NOT GIVE A DAMN AT ALL
THERE IS NO PLACE LIKE HOME IN THIS GREAT BIG WORLD
ELEMENTARY MY DEAR WATSON SAID THE GREAT DETECTIVE FROM LONDON
TO BE OR NOT TO BE THAT IS THE ONLY QUESTION
A JOURNEY OF A THOUSAND MILES BEGINS WITH A SINGLE STEP
THE ONLY TRUE WISDOM IS IN KNOWING YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
DO NOT COUNT YOUR CHICKENS BEFORE THEY HAVE ACTUALLY HATCHED
THE UNEXAMINED LIFE IS NOT WORTH LIVING FOR ANYONE AT ALL
FORTUNE FAVORS THE BOLD BUT SHE ALSO FAVORS THE PREPARED MIND
NOT ALL THOSE WHO WANDER IN THIS WORLD ARE NECESSARILY LOST
LIFE IS WHAT HAPPENS WHILE YOU ARE BUSY MAKING OTHER PLANS
IN THE MIDDLE OF EVERY DIFFICULTY LIES A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
